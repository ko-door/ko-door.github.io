## Dynamic Programming
### when?

- maximize/minimize something(one final answer)
- make a decision depeding on previous decisions(multiple intermediate stages)
- solve sub-problem repeatedly with recursion(overlapping subproblems)

### how?

- top-down(memoization): recursive function, memoization
- bottom-up(tabulation): iteration, dp array
